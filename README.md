## ✨ Why We Built This

**The Problem**: $640 billion in waste by 2050. But here's what we discovered: it's not from big mistakes. It's from small ones that compound.

You've stood in front of three bins. Trash. Recycling. Compost. And in that moment, you don't know which one. You guess. **8 out of 10 times**, people sort wrong. Small mistake. Multiply that by every business, every day, for decades. 

**California's Challenge**: SB 1383 mandates organic waste diversion, but **500,000+ California businesses** face fines and fees they don't expect. Not because they're careless. Because it's unclear. Universities, restaurants, offices, municipalities all dealing with the same "3-second hesitation" that costs them thousands in penalties, contamination fees, and lost recycling deductions.

**Our Solution**: EcoSmartLoop turns that moment of hesitation into a moment of clarity. AI-powered mobile scanning built in **4 months**, starting with California and designed to scale nationwide.
